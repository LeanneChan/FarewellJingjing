2,Christopher Lee,"Hi Jingjing, congrats on surviving 2 years of municipal issues! Very glad to have had the opportunity to work with you on a variety of work from Ops Tech, Pre-Cab paper to more recently Analytics and NAIS. Most importantly, thanks for being the practical and structured voice of reason esp. in meetings that might turn chaotic in the past. Also, not forgetting how game you were in joining a bunch of us to Malacca! Iâ€™ve definitely learnt a lot from you (from your working style, words of wisdom) and hope that weâ€™ll get to cross paths again!
